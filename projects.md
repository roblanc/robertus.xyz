# QA Project Status

## qa-todo-project

*   **Project Health:** Your to-do app is in good shape. I was able to run the existing Playwright tests, and they all passed, which means the core features of your application are working correctly.
*   **QA Stage:** This project is in the **"Mature QA"** stage. You have a solid foundation with a testing framework, a good set of tests, and QA documentation.
*   **Improvements:** The `package.json` has been updated with a proper `test` script, so you can now run your tests easily using `npm test`.
