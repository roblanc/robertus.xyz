 - Romanian far-right politician and agronomist known for his work in sustainable development, including roles like President of the European Research Centre for the Club of Rome (2013–2015) and UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and hazardous waste. He ran as an independent in the 2024 Romanian presidential election, winning 23% in the first round despite low initial polls, with views described as pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and ultranationalist. His campaign faced allegations of Russian interference and undeclared funding, leading to the election’s cancellation by Romania’s Constitutional Court in December 2024. In 2025, he was detained, charged with offenses like incitement against the constitutional order, and barred from rerunning in the May election, sparking controversy and protests.
