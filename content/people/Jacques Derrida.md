- A few years ago I was studying (analytic) philosophy at University of Stockholm and I remember when a student brought up Derrida in question at a lecture . The professor looked at him surprised and answered some like "Well, don't think to much about that. Isn't Derrida basically just intellectual poop?" So at least Derrida wasn't a big hit at that University.
- I don't think he's relevant to any non-continental program, really. His ideas are mostly eclipsed by much clearer or lucid expressions in logic, philosophy of language, or epistemology, and his political works, while usually hitting on great topics, do little to actually theoretically justify his theses (though he'd be skeptical of the process of justification).
