- the biggest account on X that spreads misinformation
	- he changed the algo to counter that as he thinks that the things he is spreading are true e.g. he links a mainstream media article about X topic and says that "this is bad" --- once community notes point out that "this is not bad and here's why" --- he blames the community notes for being gamed and goes on on changing the community notes
- went a little bit crazy once he acquired Twitter and made it X
- driven by the mission to go to Mars in his lifetime (prolly) --- when you are the richest man in the world, what else can you dream of? 
- [[Ketamine]] user
- was a democrat but I feel that once one of his child turned out to be transgender, he went mad and blamed what he calls "the woke mind virus"
