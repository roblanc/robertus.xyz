Notes based on this: [Jeffrey Sachs Brings Real Politics to the EU Parliament](https://youtu.be/_RNE3X41IvM?si=5LRemySW6HWQjl4V)

- ppl say he is a Russian propagandist so beware
- thinks that the 2003 Irak war was planned by [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and the Pentagon, a war for Israel
	- thinks that was the last time that Europe had a voice
- Europe lost its voice in 2008
- [[Donald Trump]] is an arms salesmen --- also said that Vance told Europe not to even think having their own AI technology
- [[Donald Trump]] does not like the losing hand, so this is why most likely this war will end 
- he believes in [[climate change]]
- he believes that the [OSCE](https://www.osce.org/) is the proper framework for European security
- says that most European leaders do not want to hear anything from him (I wonder why?)
- says that the [US blew up North Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Stream_pipelines_sabotage)
- thinks Europe needs a real policy --- he keeps repeating this but I do wonder how do you create a coherent policy when you have all of these countries with different cultures (Europe) and ideologies having to formulate similar things they believe in, vote for them and then got to Russia make deals --- the main reason the US vs Russia thingy works is because there are 2 opposing forces that do not have too many open chinks in their armours /// China does not have chinks, it is one cohesive nation /// Europe can't have that cuz of cultural diversity and because EUROPE IS NOT A COUNTRY LIKE RUSSIA OR CHINA OR US --- you will always have situations where Romanians won't agree with Hungary thanks to the XYZ historical context, or Serbians will fight Croatians cuz of the 90s shit --- all of these countries and cultures have pride, while there will also be a battle for historical revisionism when talking about things such as: "oh, this song is actually from Romania! No it is not! It has a Serbian origin" --- [Before you continue to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Fabr1s/videos) --- so you will always sort of be under the influence of a single nation with a bigger stick
- thinks the Israel lobby dominates US foreign policy & [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] a war criminal
	- similar to [[President Sunday]]
- says that [[China]] is not an enemy but a success story /// mkay? I remember that the Chinese were hypercapitalistic and focused on the "[One China Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_China#:~:text=The%20One%20China%20principle%20is,an%20inalienable%20part%20of%20China)" and do not even mind the surveillance 
- thinks that the best thing for the Baltic states is to stop the russofobia, various Baltic states have lots of Russian speaking citizens --- oh noez another chink in the armour that Russia can leverage --- utopically true but this is the real world
- he thinks that NATO is not needed

[Sachs studied economics at Harvard and is currently working as the Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University and as the President of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.](https://x.com/P_Kallioniemi/status/1652683683969527810)


Likes the saying of [[Henry Kissinger]]: "It may be dangerous to be America's enemy, but to be America's friend is fatal."

- thinks that [[Putin]] invaded Ukraine to force [[Zelensky]] to negotiate 

[This is a video](https://youtu.be/_RNE3X41IvM?si=xyNLfjPk3WQZSrgH) featuring a pro-Russian propagandist - who also has some extremely questionable views on human rights abuses by the likes of China - uploaded to a YouTube channel ran by a YouTuber turned MEP oft described as "Elon Musk's man in the European Parliament". Make of that what you will.
