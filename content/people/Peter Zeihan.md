[The Russian Reach: Series Introduction \|\| PETER ZEIHAN - YouTube](https://youtu.be/lGFKwshHjWQ?si=I6Y-CmdFkq51XITr)

- Zeihan worked at [Stratfor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratfor), he says we urgently need to befriend Turkey and possibly Poland at the level of weapon production and security. Romania needs to befriend them until we develop our 'muscles'
- for the first time Peter started doing what he is doing, he said that he is worried for the US
- thinks that what [[Elon Musk]] is currently doing with DOGE as of [[2025-03-09]] is not worth the time as it is a chunk of change
- thinks USAID got a lot of crap for doing some strange things, but if you are not going to invade or occupy a country, USAID is US's primary mechanism to influence countries around the world; when this is not present, the Iranians, Chinese and the Russians will dominate the space as they will step in with relief support
- ultimately this is an actual disassembly of american power which goes into a little bit of conspiracy BUT:
	- consider that the Russians have already penetrated the White House
	- there are too many things happening too fast 
	- everything that is on the list of the things happening is something that the Russians have tried before
	- even [[Ben Shapiro]] things that the fact that the US does not support Ukraine anymore is weird and he said that he does not understand this policy at all

Unlike the U.S., many European countries use a proportional representation system where parties receive seats in parliament based on their share of the vote. This system allows for a broader range of political parties, including those on the far right, to gain representation.

The design of these systems, intended to be inclusive, leads to a multiplicity of parties from various political spectrums—including extreme left and right factions—contributing to a more fragmented political landscape.

Post-World War II urbanization and industrialization in Europe, especially in countries like Spain and Italy, led to significant declines in birth rates. While countries like Germany and the UK experienced gradual declines, Southern Europe saw more rapid changes.

Many European countries have aging populations due to decades of low birth rates. As people age, they tend to become more conservative, which shifts the political spectrum rightward.

The aging population’s focus shifts away from progressive social policies and economic development towards maintaining their benefits and pensions, further fueling conservative and populist sentiments.

The introduction of the Euro during a period of economic prosperity among middle-aged Europeans was feasible due to their significant contributions to the tax base and savings. However, as this demographic retires, the economic stability that supported the Euro is under threat.

The retiring population, particularly in Germany, is increasingly concerned about inflation, which could exacerbate financial tensions within the Eurozone.

Zeihan concludes that the combination of inclusive electoral systems and demographic aging will likely lead to more conservative, populist, and far-right politics across Europe, with countries like Italy and Germany at the forefront of this shift.
