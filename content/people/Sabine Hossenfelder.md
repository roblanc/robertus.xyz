- thinks Microsoft made progress with the new quantum chip
- makes fun of [[Elon Musk]]
- good when she popularizes subjects that are well understood.
- good when she criticizes oversimplified physics phenomena that other physics channels do not care to explain extensively. 
- mildly ok when she expresses opinions on which fields of physics should be funded or not, but she definitely should put a warning somewhere. 
- very very bad when she tries to popularize a solution to a physics problem that has no consensus but she still talks as if her solutions is unique and uncontestable (any video of her on interpretations of QM or dark matter). 
	The last is a clear no no because she seems to do more harm than good. It is like teaching somebody to play the piano starting with your favorite niche experimental band that makes music by burning instruments (maybe there are better analogies).
