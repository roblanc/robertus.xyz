Dear fellow internet dweller,

Youâ€™ve managed to find your way into my working notes, which Iâ€™ve accumulated over the course of several years. This database is part of my endeavor to arrange my own notions and ideas in a more public place where I can link notes on various topics together. These are in a constant state of flux. I also post/experiment with visual trickery on my YouTube channel, ideas and theories that interest me. I use it to alleviate boredom and occasionally heighten my thought processes. I am a systematizer, and this is my pocket dimension!
