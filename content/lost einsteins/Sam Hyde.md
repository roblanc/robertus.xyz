# Sam Hyde Notes

## Life & Career Lessons
 • Corporate jobs can teach valuable skills (work speed, file handling, business processes), even if the work is unpleasant.
 • There’s a difference between “toil” (soul-crushing labor) and work that provides experience or value.
 • If your job is pure toil and provides nothing, you should leave; but if you’re learning, it’s worth sticking with for a while.
 • Having a mentor in your 20s is extremely valuable—find someone experienced who can teach you.
 • Don’t waste time endlessly deliberating between options; when faced with a fork in the road, just pick one and move forward.
 • Money is a form of “meta-energy” that you trade your time, effort, and life for—respect its importance.
 • Avoid lifestyle inflation: when you start earning more, don’t immediately upgrade your lifestyle (e.g., buying luxury cars).
 • Don’t spend more than 5% of your net worth on a car or luxury item.
 • Expensive cars and luxury goods are rarely worth it; the difference in experience is often negligible.
 • If you’re unhappy, focus on being functional and disciplined rather than chasing happiness.
 • Set goals, find something worth fighting for, and dedicate yourself to it for fulfillment.
 • Discipline problems often stem from not having clear goals.
 • It can take years to figure out what people will pay you for—expect a long search for monetizable skills.
 • If you find something that works, pursue it with intensity (“hammer it”).
 • If your job is painful but pays well, at least save the money—don’t waste it on short-term relief.
 • Avoid addiction and destructive habits; they will sabotage your progress.
 • Success often comes from being present, likable, and open to opportunities, not just from targeted effort.
 • Most people don’t regret not “enjoying their 20s”—they regret not building something meaningful.
 • Don’t get fixated on material status symbols; focus on building real value and skills.

## Corporate Job Experience
Sam Hyde learned valuable business processes and work habits from his corporate job, despite disliking it.

In the video, Sam Hyde describes his experience working at a sports marketing company that did signage for stadiums. Although he found the job unpleasant and realized he wasn’t suited for corporate 9-to-5 work, he highlights a few key things he learned:
 • He picked up useful skills like work speed and file handling procedures.
 • He observed how a medium-sized corporate business manages every element of its operations.
 • This exposure gave him insight into professional business processes, which he found valuable later on.

Here’s how he puts it:

“I had a job doing Sports Marketing which very much sucked ass but I got my work speed and my file handling procedure from that place. I got to see how a corporate 9 to 5 medium-sized business handles their… so I was picking stuff up.”

So, even though the job was not enjoyable, it provided him with practical skills and an understanding of how businesses operate, which he considers useful experience.

## Controversial Views / Reddit Post
- viewed as a nazi on the general internet; I do not know if I agree yet, I haven't watched or read his stuff yet [`Fri, 24 May`]

**8 years ago on reddit:** 

Just speaking for myself (Sam)--

I'll always have anarchic/outsider sympathies/tendencies but... the SJW stuff and the diversity stuff have gone too far, past the point of no return. And I'm a super tolerant guy, I'm perfectly happy to have people screaming in my face and insulting me if that's what it takes to have prosperity and a stable and fair society. But if you read enough of this shit you realize that's not the endgame plan--the plan is to have anything white/masculine/traditional totally eliminated or suppressed.

A year or two back, I might've said the most important issues were... surveillance, ending the war on drugs, campaign finance reform, military adventurism--something like that. But I've grown weary of having all this feminist nihilist shit plopped on my lap, and I'm tired of people telling me that I've got some original sin and the only way to cleanse myself is by acting like Tim Wise. Gamergate was eye-opening, #BlackLivesMatter was eye-opening, but what really drove the point home and crystalized this perspective was reading about things like Rotherham...

Europe is in a dire situation: culture is being destroyed, some neighborhoods are being turned into trash dumps, and a lot of these places might not ever be the same. I don't think that's a good thing, or a healthy thing, to take people who build statues and create wealth and invent science and replace them with people who use alleyways as bathrooms and are 10-20x more likely to rape. I'm sorry I just don't think that's good, I know it's insensitive as hell, but it's too late now to tiptoe around it or use a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to explain it differently. This is just the way it is, Europe is in a dire situation: culture is being destroyed, some neighborhoods are being turned into trash dumps, and a lot of these places might not ever be the same. I don't think that's a good thing, or a healthy thing, to take people who build statues and create wealth and invent science and replace them with people who use alleyways as bathrooms and are 10-20x more likely to rape. I'm sorry I just don't think that's good, I know it's insensitive as hell, but it's too late now to tiptoe around it or use a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to explain it differently. This is just the way it is, Europe is being invaded and we'd better fucking wake up if we have any chance of preventing that from happening here.

It's possible to feel this way and at the same time be compassionate. Send them money, let them use the technology we invented, give them whatever they need to pull themselves out of poverty, quit starting wars for oil and for Israel--all that stuff is well and good, but by keeping borders open we're taking the most productive, inventive, civilized, free countries and dumping them into the incinerator. Of course we have problems, of course the NSA is bad, of course it would be nice if we could all have $15 an hour for whatever, but would you rather live here, or in Malaysia or China or Saudi Arabia? Do you really think the best way to make our society more Utopian is by importing displacement levels of Malays, Chinese, or Saudis?

Whether you think the problem is genetic or cultural, it doesn't matter when you import immigrants in large numbers, because they form communities that don't integrate. They bring their language and their religion with them, and they vote for socialist policies. This will continue until white people have been sucked dry, and then there won't be any voting anymore, there'll be Sharia law instead. We're putting Western Civ on the alter as a sacrifice to white guilt because we're worried some frizzy-haired Afro transsexual will wag his finger at us.

We didn't build all this shit and invent all this shit, our ancestors did--it's only ours to safeguard, not to flush down the toilet. You didn't get burned at the stake for saying something heretical, your ancestors did, so it's pretty fucking shameful if you're ready to give up your guard post for intellectual freedom and separation of church and state because some snarky tattooed dyke is hissing at you. These fuckers have shifted everything so far out of wack and to not fight back now is the same thing as being on their side.

Comedy shouldn't be 'political'... Sensitive WASPy types don't like when things get publicly political. Sam Hyde is funny I just wish he wouldn't be 'political'... First of all, nobody even BATS A FUCKING EYE when Zach Galifianakis or Jim Carrey dips into some political issue that they know nothing about (because their views fall safely in the bubble of insanity that is societally accepted as 'OK'). Secondly.... THIS ISN'T EVEN POLITICAL! The slow smothering death of Western Civilization is not a political issue, it's a historical issue, as in we are toying with the fruits of 2000 years of bloody labor as if they're just piNata prizes.

I don't want to shove politics in everyone's face all the time. I happen to think that free-market capitalism kicks socialism's ass and that spying and war are bad. I voted for Gary Johnson in 2012. If you think that a universal basic income is a good idea, or that weed should remain illegal, or think whatever about gay marriage, I don't care about those things enough to alienate viewers and I'm trying to shove my opinions in your face as little as possible. Even if you think that people are born boys and turn into girls, whatever, I think Bruce Jenner is really funny but I don't care enough to go beyond making jokes about ropes. But this isn't about politics, it's about having an identity and a home and not losing these beautiful civilizations that took so long to create.

The future is headed towards Cormac McCarthy's The Road and talking/thinking about it gives you an uh-oh boo-boo feeling in your tummy because someone might call you waycis? A lot of people have been hitting me up recently to ask about this, and everybody comes to the same conclusion, they agree and can see what's happening, but addressing it head-on gives them a no-no feeling, like a bad. They feel a bad, and they worry that people will think they're bad racers, shame no-no.

This doesn't mean you have to start hating black people or using racial slurs or deliberately making yourself unpopular at parties, but whites need to regain some sort of cohesive tribal self-interest and identity right now just like everybody else has or in fifty years this country is going to be like Brazil (the bad parts, not the sexy babes and beaches and rich dudes in white linen suits). It's possible to have compassion for Third-Worlders, goodwill towards all mankind, respectful conversations with and attitudes towards people who don't look like you, and at the same time not want your own country to become a cesspit :) Sorry for getting all 'political', I'll go make some funny faces now!
