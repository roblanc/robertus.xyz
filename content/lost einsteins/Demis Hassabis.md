**Sir Demis Hassabis** is a British computer scientist, artificial intelligence researcher and entrepreneur. He is the co-founder and CEO of [[Google DeepMind]].

He is a former child chess prodigy, who finished his A-levels two years early and then programmed the classic game *Theme Park* at Bullfrog Productions. He graduated from Cambridge University with a Double First in computer science, and founded the videogames company Elixir Studios, producing the BAFTA-nominated *Republic: The Revolution*.

After a decade of experience in the games industry, Hassabis returned to academia to obtain a PhD in cognitive neuroscience at University College London, followed by post-doctoral research at MIT and Harvard.

In 2010, he co-founded DeepMind, a London-based machine learning AI startup. DeepMind was acquired by Google in 2014. Under Hassabis's leadership, DeepMind has been responsible for a number of significant breakthroughs in AI, including AlphaGo, the first program to defeat a professional Go player, and AlphaFold, which has been heralded as a solution to the 50-year-old grand challenge of protein structure prediction.

He is a 5-time winner of the Mind Sports Olympiad and a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024.

He has a friendly rivalry with [[Elon Musk]].

Demis is the priestly class of AI

he's not some running on VC money, he's not traveling the world shaking hands with sheikhs, he's in London in the lab doing kooky british science stuff. 

he doesn't have to worry about the money like a startup, he's far from the silicon valley mindvirus, he just ships

while oAI tries to find the right amount of sycophancy, Demis is solving Go, solving worldgen, folding proteins.

you never see the ego, monk-like demeanor.
