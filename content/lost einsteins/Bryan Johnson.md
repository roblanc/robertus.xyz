I injected the horse tranquilizer Ketamine and tracked my brain data for 15 days. It completely scrambled my brain. In a world-first we answered the question ‘what happens to the brain before, during, and after ketamine treatment?’ We also discovered how long it took for my brain to return to ‘normal’.

- The experiment's focus was on understanding the changes in brain function before, during, and after ketamine treatment, highlighting its potential in altering neuroplasticity, which could have therapeutic benefits in fields like depression treatment.
    
- The study involved tracking brain data for 15 days post-ketamine injection, revealing that the drug's effects on brain connectivity lasted over three days, providing insights into the duration of its impact on brain patterns.

**Before Ketamine**: Bryan's brain activity followed fixed, predictable patterns, similar to how air traffic would follow established routes in a global network.

**During and After Ketamine**: After the administration of ketamine, these patterns were completely scrambled. Instead of the usual structured connectivity, the brain activity became more flexible and varied, akin to rerouting air traffic to less-used airports. This change suggests that ketamine might unlock new neural connections, potentially facilitating new ways of thinking or therapeutic benefits.

**Duration of Effects**: The effects of ketamine on brain activity lasted for over three days, indicating a significant window during which the brain's functional connectivity was altered. This period is often referred to as the "therapeutic window," where changes in brain function could be harnessed for treatment purposes.

**Return to Normal**: After three days, Bryan's brain began to revert to its previous patterns, showing that the brain's functional connectivity started to normalize, though it took time for it to fully return to baseline.

These findings suggest that ketamine **has a profound impact on brain function**, with potential therapeutic applications due to its ability to **alter established neural pathways temporarily**. The study provided a world-first insight into how long it takes for the brain to return to its 'normal' state post-ketamine treatment, emphasizing the drug's unique effects on neuroplasticity.
