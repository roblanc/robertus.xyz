A fragment of text floated past my feed. One line about how danger rarely walks through the front door. It stuck.

We brace for the obvious disasters and overlook the creeping ones. Technology moves sideways, almost casual. By the time we notice, it's already settled in.

Three quick lessons from the thread:

1. Question your defaults.
2. Track the small shifts; they accumulate fast.
3. Expect surprises and stay ready to adapt.

I've started jotting down these detailsâ€”the weird glitches, the subtle changes in how I work, how people talk, how tools reshape our habits. Maybe it'll help me spot trouble early. Maybe it just keeps me honest.

Either way, eyes open. Hands steady. The future rarely announces itself.
