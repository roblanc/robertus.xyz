Open source thrives on the contributions of curious minds. By openly sharing our tools and techniques, we build projects that are greater than the sum of their parts. Even small fixes or clarifications can have an outsized impact when shared with a global community.

This short note encourages new contributors to take the plunge. Submit a pull request, document a tricky issue, or help triage bugs. Collaboration is how we keep pushing boundaries together.
