## Go fast to stay authentic

==If you’re building a product, there are lots of reasons to go fast. It’s cheaper. You get to market sooner. If you’re off course, you might find out before it’s too late.==

But last week I was reminded of what might be the most important reason to go fast: Going fast prevents you from second-guessing. Speed keeps you authentic. If you’ve got a weird, opinionated, crazy, possibly-stupid-possibly-great plan, and you take a long time to think it through, revise it, and make it perfect, you water down and wash out the goodness.

My realization came from [[Jason Fried]], who has been an inspiration to me for over a decade, and who I got to [interview](https://soundcloud.com/ajsmartdesign/x-jason-fried-gives-us-savage-product-advice) on a podcast. Jason talked a lot about how they use speed at Basecamp—like their famous [6-week cycles](https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-set-up-our-work-cbce3d3d9cae). He talked about how he uses speed when he writes on Medium—every [post](https://medium.com/@jasonfried) in 15–20 minutes, holy jeez.

When you move that fast, sometimes you’re wrong. But you don’t waste time watering things down.

I’m not (only) parroting Jason here. I’ve seen the speed-keeps-you-authentic effect in design sprints. Without time to equivocate, the solutions are better. And I’ve had the painful first-hand experience of wavering, redoing, redoing, redoing, and forgetting the point.

Right now I’m recommitting to speed. If you’re writing, there are lots of reasons to go fast. You won’t lose your nerve. You won’t lose your inspiration. You won’t edit yourself to death.

For the next few weeks, ==I’ll imitate Jason and go fast to stay authentic with my Medium posts==… I have a hundred ideas I don’t have time to write properly and preciously, but I _do_ have 15 minutes.

Let’s see if this headline is true.

	Ah, speed is not defined by how quickly you make the decision. Speed is defined by how quickly you act on the decision after it’s made. Very different things here. You might make an immediate decision but it might take your team seven weeks to implement it because your organization is inefficient in other ways — too much management, too many layers, too many people, complicated tech, sluggish workflows, etc. We might make a decision over three or four days and only take two weeks to implement it. Which was “quicker”.
