Notes based on this: Jeffrey Sachs Brings Real Politics to the EU Parliament

- ppl say he is a Russian propagandist so beware
- thinks that the 2003 Irak war was planned by [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and the Pentagon, a war for Israel
	- thinks that was the last time that Europe had a voice
- Europe lost its voice in 2008
- [[Trump]] does not like the losing hand, so this is why most likely this war will end 
- says that most European leaders do not want to hear anything from him (I wonder why?)
- says that the [US blew up North Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Stream_pipelines_sabotage)
- thinks Europe needs a real policy
- thinks the Israel lobby dominates US foreign policy & [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] a war criminal
	- similar to [[President Sunday]]
- says that [[China]] is not an enemy but a success story /// mkay? I remember that the Chinese were hypercapitalistic and focused on the "[One China Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_China#:~:text=The%20One%20China%20principle%20is,an%20inalienable%20part%20of%20China)" and do not even mind the surveillance 

[Sachs studied economics at Harvard and is currently working as the Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University and as the President of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.](https://x.com/P_Kallioniemi/status/1652683683969527810)


Likes the saying of [[Henry Kissinger]]: "It may be dangerous to be America's enemy, but to be America's friend is fatal."

- thinks that [[Putin]] invaded Ukraine to force [[Zelensky]] to negotiate 



[This is a video](https://youtu.be/_RNE3X41IvM?si=xyNLfjPk3WQZSrgH) featuring a pro-Russian propagandist - who also has some extremely questionable views on human rights abuses by the likes of China - uploaded to a YouTube channel ran by a YouTuber turned MEP oft described as "Elon Musk's man in the European Parliament". Make of that what you will.
