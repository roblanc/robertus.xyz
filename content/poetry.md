## I felt a Funeral, in my Brain

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading - treading - till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through -

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum -
Kept beating - beating - till I thought
My mind was going numb -

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space - began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race,
Wrecked, solitary, here -

And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down -
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing - then -

— Emily Dickinson


## I waited so long for love

I waited so long for love and suddenly, here it is standing in the garden, hands full of heirlooms hot from the sun.

Soon, we'll make a supper of them. Salted slabs between slices of bread.
Your beard silvers. My hips ripen. The mail piles up.

Phone calls go unanswered. Forgive us. Our mouths are full of tomatoes.
We are so busy being small and hungry and alive.

— Joy Sullivan

## Pluton

Aştept primăvara:
vreau să fiu dus de un pluton suav
la primul zid şi împuşcat cu muguri
şi când voi muri să-mi înflorească toate rănile,
să vină toate albinele la rănile mele
şi să mă transporte pe aripi
către tărâmul de polen unde merită să ajung
cu flori cu tot, cu tristeţe cu tot,
cu primăvară cu tot,
acum şi-n veacul vecilor.

— Adrian Păunescu

## All that is gold does not glitter

All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.

— J. R. R. Tolkien

## I sit beside the fire and think

I sit beside the fire and think
of all that I have seen
of meadow-flowers and butterflies
in summers that have been;

Of yellow leaves and gossamer
in autumns that there were,
with morning mist and silver sun
and wind upon my hair.

I sit beside the fire and think
of how the world will be
when winter comes without a spring
that I shall ever see.

For still there are so many things
that I have never seen:
in every wood in every spring
there is a different green.

I sit beside the fire and think
of people long ago
and people who will see a world
that I shall never know.

But all the while I sit and think
of times there were before,
I listen for returning feet
and voices at the door.

— J. R. R. Tolkien
