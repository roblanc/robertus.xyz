title: Compression
---

As a consequence of 
Short-form content, 
Information density must go up 
On a per-content basis
Or it is quickly deemed irrelevant.


This means;
human communication protocols 
are self-compressing 
over time; 
a hallmark of civilization maturity.

Worry not,
about its addictive effects. 

Natural selection will weed out 
the ones addicted 
who lose agency.

Plan for what it means
to have a species that operates
at such high communication information densities, 

while also living 
an average of 100 years.

### A Counter-Argument

Conditioning for short attention spans with shallow, impressionable information is neither information compression nor a hallmark of anything.

You are wrong, and youâ€™re deducting praises for civilization from an exploited dopamine trigger.
