[[Elon Musk]] AI system but he is constantly changing the algo so beware.

As of February 25, 2025: 
- According to grok: USA is actually failed European project gone rogue. The USA started as a collection of European colonies—mostly British, but with French, Spanish, and Dutch flavors thrown in—built on grand ideas of freedom, self-governance, and a fresh start. Those ideas came straight out of Europe’s Enlightenment, but the execution? Messy.
- when [[Linus Ekenstam]] asked Grok who is the biggest disinformation spread on X, [[Elon Musk]] changed the algo and blamed mainstream media, bots etc.

- there's also another user called Isaac Saul who asked Grok to [analyze the last 1,000 posts from Elon Musk](https://x.com/Ike_Saul/status/1892623014300107253) for truth and veracity. More than half of what Elon posts on X is false or misleading, while most of the "true" posts are simply updates about his companies.
