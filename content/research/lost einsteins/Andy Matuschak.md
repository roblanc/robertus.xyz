[Time-Out Timer](https://apps.apple.com/ro/app/time-out-break-reminders/id402592703?mt=12) for Pomodoro stuff.

Where does misery come from? I'm asking this honestly, not really rhetorically. Let me try to answer my own question. Let me say first off that I am, broadly speaking, very opposed to what I understand to be David Gogginsesque attitude towards almost anything. In this particular instance, I think what I think is something like, if I ask why is it miserable to learn a particular subject? The answers that come to mind are things like, first off, I don't care about this subject. And I think that's not what we're talking about. You're asking about a world in which these great tools exist and someone's using one of these tools to try to do something they really care about. So another reason why it could be miserable that I think is pretty common is that you have some idea about, you're not going fast enough, or you're failing, or you're struggling, and the misery comes from resisting that. It comes from feeling like you're doing poorly and you shouldn't be doing poorly, it's bad that you're doing poorly.

	I was in Andy's dorm (house) at Caltech. When I matriculated, I chose begrudgingly to study a "real" science--physics--instead of what I actually liked--computer science. It was in no small part thanks to Andy's contagious and unabashed excitement for CS that I eventually switched over and became a happy software engineer.

about note-taking
	"People who write extensively about note-writing rarely have a serious context of use Many bloggers and “life-hackers” have made a full-time job of suggesting how you should organize your journal, or how you should most effectively Write about what you read. We should take this advice seriously insofar as those practices have helped the authors achieve meaningful creative work: “Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”

he had a project attempt to [migrate his notes fro Bear to Obsidian](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6JqB9qp7ApgfpPkn8NQh6r) (deleted his notes on that but it was interesting to see his migration process)

Meditation timing:
- First thing? But sleepy before coffee.
  - After coffee? But it takes me 30m to drink—awkward time gap.
  - Afternoon, after main working block? Mind dull…
  - Sol'n (this year): coffee + 30m of planning+reflecting on paper, then meditate, then main working block
