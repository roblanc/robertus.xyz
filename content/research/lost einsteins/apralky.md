about [[Curtis Yarvin]]
- eternal testament to the usefulness of interpretive social sciences that in a world where a gazillion IQ135+ PhDs are churning out thousands of pages of Theory a day, the guy who ended up modelling contemporary power structures by far the best is a compsci dropout going at it from first principles in his san francisco bedroom while holding down an unrelated day job


#### On machiavellianism
- naive machiavellian: lie in the early game, get found out, never get to the late game trve machiavellian: honest in the early game, so so honest... everyone thinks.. oh yeah, this is the honest guy... he'd never hurt a fly.. but in the late game? once harvest ripens? he lies...
- pre-internet trve machiavellians don't understand how much more efficient internet ecosystems are, i.e. how much harder you need to feign honesty in the early game post-internet than pre-internet, so they start slimemaxxing too early and drop like flies (common in millennials)
- this is obviously because having many thousands, millions of people scrutinize you in an IQ selected smooth information cluster is way way way different than your constant rotation of 10 midwitted friends & colleagues
- this is true to such an extent that in many ways it's impossible to lie to an online audience, it is a hyperefficient info market at a certain size, so you must indeed become honest early on, and somehow later on decide to snap back to evilmaxxing as your honest self, a quandry

I got 20k followers in 2 months! here's what 20k followers in 2 months has gotten me: > an avenue to express myself > invaluable connections in globally influential communities > ~10-20 real life friends > a fresh sense of belonging & community > a powerful search engine which can tap into unwritten communal info banks > eerily loud sustained tone in my living room daily at 3:00 am lasting ~10 minutes > identical black van parked in the corner of my street every night from 1-5 am > a weekly unanswered anonymous phone call inbound from Tel Aviv > a picture of my elderly grandmother mailed to my inbox with the eyes carved out > half a dozen pseudonymous emails all with a certain defence contractor's domain subjected "Cordial Advice Regarding Artistic Direction" > a 5-fold increase in screen time

#### What Are We Trying to Do?
###### Gamifying life through the power-maxxing protocol
#### Influence is broadly the utility function

Before doing anything, it’s reasonable to ask why: why am I planning to start writing long-form articles on Substack? Why am I planning to do anything at all? Why do I spend my free time the way I do? What’s my utility function? How do I specify a proximate utility function which is real-time parsable, allowing for conscious optimization? These are complicated questions, and I won’t try to walk you through how I’ve tried to get the answers (unless you’d really like me to). But I will give you the conclusion: **the variable I’m currently trying to maximize is personal ideological influence**, that’s the utility function. You can call it _power-maxxing._ It’s fairly straightforward, and I try to make sure that everything I do is pegged to it. I’ll go one step further and suggest you copy my utility function too — it’s a fun one, and if you’re reading this, odds are you’re a lost soul. You’ve probably long yearned for this sort of guidance. If you’re in, keep reading! Influence is much easier with even loose forms of [collective coordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networked_advocacy).

#### Isn’t influence too much of a moonshot?

At this stage you may be wondering:

_There are over 8 billion people in the world, chances are, a good portion of them would also love to have ideological influence, which is somewhat status-exchangeable. What are the odds that you or I can beat them to it? Aren’t we just rat-racing to nowhere?_

Not at all. You’re reading this, which means that you’ve already self-selected into an incredibly advantageous position in the global network. You’re 0, 1, or at most 2 steps removed from most of the influential thinkers, politicians, and businessmen of our time. Don’t believe me? Try this: pick a name that you think fits that description. Look them up on X, they probably have an account. How many mutuals are you away from direct contact? How many of your tweets has Elon liked? Have any made it to the White House? How many reciprocal interactions have you had with Marc Andreessen? Sam Altman? BAP? Eliezer Yudkowsky? Nick Land? Curtis Yarvin? maybe JD Vance?… You’re already in the epicentre of global power, culture, and capital: if not physically, then cognitively. You’re extremely privileged. Your success isn’t actually bottlenecked by gruelling large-number stochastics. There’s world-scale power locked inside your phone and it takes something like 5,000 good posts to get it out.

#### The Protocol

Alright, you’re sold. Let’s maximize influence. _How exactly do we go on about this? What are the actual openings? What’s the tangible protocol? Circling back, how do I personally plan to go on about this? How have I been going on about this so far?_

These are great questions. Keep reading.

There exist a number of ways in which one can maximize their ideological influence. In the remainder of this piece I’ll specifically focus on the _intellectual_ pathway. Other pathways include maximizing one’s disposable capital (getting rich), maximizing one’s political stature, marrying a person who has already maximized or will subsequently maximize one or more of these, and so on. Most people whom I consider exemplar power-maxxers have either combined the _intellectual_ and _political_ pathways (e.g. Henry Kissinger), or the _intellectual_ and _disposable capital_ pathways (e.g. Peter Thiel, George Soros). The reason I chose to focus on the intellectual pathway here is that it’s the pathway that needs to be maximized in public, through domains such as this one. It’s obvious why — you can’t intellectually influence people unless they’re hearing what you have to say. Capital doesn’t work like that.

#### The intellectual pathway of power-maxxing

I like to model the intellectual pathway of power-maxxing as a two-stage process:

1. In the beginning, we don’t have an audience. No matter what we say, or how well we say it, no one will hear it. Therefore, the natural first stage is to actually gain an audience of people who will listen to us and are worth talking to. Let’s posit that we will be following the digital form of _intellectual power-maxxing_ (as opposed to the traditional institutional forms, such as those managed through the academy, a church, or legacy journalism). You and I have an obvious natural advantage in the digital form, we’re young and chronically online. The digital form also happens to be the most viable one, thanks to both the rapid and universal proliferation of social media access and addiction, as well as the overwhelming range of degrees of freedom it offers to an independent operator. Opting for _digital intellectual power-maxxing_ makes the suitable audience apparent — we need to find persons who are themselves chronically online and possess world-scale influence of their own. This narrows the list of viable options to a relatively small cluster of American coastal elites, mostly tech, finance, policy, and academia adjacent, who all happen to hang around in the same circles on X. Our first stage goal is to amass an audience consisting of a moderate swathe of such people (you’ll reach the rest through network diffusion). I think I've done a relatively good job at this, so I consider stage 1 broadly completed. This leads me to stage 2.
    
2. What happens after we’ve completed stage 1? We now have an audience of people who are themselves influential and listen to us, now we need to navigate how to _say the right things._ How and in which direction do we plan to influence our audience? The right sequence of tokens can hack anyone’s brain — there’s always a combination of words you can utter that will get the person of your choice to spawn at your doorstep in the shortest physically realistic time interval “or something”. How do we go on about finding these combinations? What makes me so confident that these people will listen to us? What should we be posting and writing about now? These questions will be covered in my next piece. In the piece after that, I’ll actually try to start saying these _right things_.

#### _Appendix_

#### I thought you hated long-form?

In short-form content, I both like and find it necessary to be provocative. It’s obvious why — provocation enhances reach — this is crucial in a media ecosystem which has gone from in some ways supply-constrained to overwhelmingly demand-constrained[1](https://katechon99.substack.com/p/what-are-we-trying-to-do#footnote-1-172346700). While being provocative, I naturally make many provocative claims. One such [claim](https://x.com/apralky/status/1959952799711547663) is that the rapid proliferation of short-form media has made long-form media anachronistic and redundant. I think this is an exaggeration and only directionally true. The production of high-quality, targeted long-form writing remains one of the highest-leverage ways of influencing key decision makers, who usually do not have the time to form their own lengthy thought-chains, and end up having to resort to arbitrating among those ready-to-wear ones they are presented with. They “outsource their thinking”. I’m trying to make it such that I’m one of those people to whom they outsource it.

In addition, one of the many obvious affordances[2](https://katechon99.substack.com/p/what-are-we-trying-to-do#footnote-2-172346700) of long-form writing is that it encourages epistemic rigor and structured, long-memory thought chains. This means that the more long-form writing you do, the more you practice these things, which are a necessary counter-balance to the attention-erosive tendency of short-form over the long run.

techno-determinism has been vindicated now what? thread

for some time, there was split discourse over whether it's reductionist to characterize all complex societal phenomena as modelable downstream of media technology with how the world has recently unfolded, this is no longer a matter of contention

international & domestic politics, warfare, the global economy, financial markets, friendships, mating, the academia ... all have rapidly changed form all downstream of a shared media-ecological change: > the proliferation of the internet

so > yes, human history is downstream of media technology > yes, a sufficiently advanced understanding of media technology slashes most entropy in human affair forecasting > yes, 140 characters is a big deal

why do I care beyond hedonistic curiosity? > because I'm in the biz of monetizing my ability to forecast things, and this worldmodel has had eerily high hit-rate on all things that have been worth forecasting in the 21st century--

calling the 2024 US election largely determined who was and wasn't a successful macro investor last year the techno-determinists were the others not techno-determinists have other wins under their belt: the NYC mayoral most recently the binary Q of crypto most bigly many more

anyway, how do we model the evolving media landscape? >boomer academics have laboured with this question for a long time, seemingly without success the failure is intuitive, they neither have firsthand experience, nor are native to the new world unlike us!

so we (thinking zoomers) have material edge both in deliberating the new paradigm and in capitalizing on its downstream ripple effects

following is my stream of consciousness attempt at such deliberation lets collapse the media shift into a smaller set of explanatory factors, intuiting the implications of these factors is easier: 1. the attention economy 2. full transparency 3. neo-orality

1. THE ATTENTION ECONOMY > information has gone from supply constrained to demand constrained with the exponentiating ease of info production, competition for attention is fiercer than ever this means that your info can't just be high signal it also needs to be provocative

the boomers & millennials don't get this, so they are no longer competitive in the information economy in the past, media revolutions were infrequent, and there was no such thing as the information economy--

so the dynamic whereby the most economically competent actors are deeply concentrated in the youngest generation is unprecedented therefore, we stand at an unprecedented precipice: the zoomers are about to inherit the boomer economy, skipping the gens in the middle.

capital chases attention rather than signal hence, attention becomes signal, because it costs capital to produce signal > maximizing attention before signal is the right play now boomers & millennials also don't get this, so they can no longer compete for capital

(this includes political, social, monetary, etc. all forms of capital) this has material and broadly foreseeable/applicable downstream implications across all matters

 the attention economy favours imprecise but concentrated info transmission (given the demand constraint) > imagery & hieroglyphs allow for this more effectively than letters

hence -- branding, art, aesthetic media & hieroglyphs (memes) are being revitalized those that don't get this and "focus on substance instead of vibes" fall behind...

2. FULL TRANSPARENCY > the internet ecosystem demands full personal openness > it is one of the characteristic "affordances" of social media those that aren't entertaining this affordance: > cannot form integral parasocial relationships > are viewed with suspicion and fail

those that do entertain it, but remain dishonest > eventually get found out, because global attention is an incredibly efficient information market so > new media rewards earnesty, making machiavellian builds broadly unviable for the first time in history since village life

full transparency begets populism + the emboldening of the "masses", because they see more easily that the emperor has no clothes, and can discuss it among eachother this proliferates the confidence of establishing alternative parallel metasystems e.g. crypto in place of fiat

3. NEO-ORALITY AND POST-LITERACY the internet is more oral than literate: > it's real-time conversational and broadly ephemeral literacy consequences are well explored: > monotheism > abstract science > logic > the death of tragedy > socrates > codified law > individualism

so are those of proto-orality: the reverse of all of the above. neo-orality should also directionally tempt us toward the latter: the Dionysian Descent (compounded by AGI)

- 5 days ago I made a post about how engineering majors/shape rotators are low taste and have no cultural awareness: 2k likes 0 pushback everyone laughs along 2 days ago I made a post about how humanities majors/wordcels are shit at statistics (true): civil war, thousands dead, hospital beds on the streets, 20 angry ratios, world famous bald journalists crawling out of the woodworks to dunk really makes you wonder what types of personalities they respectively select for

- 10 GPT prompts just to broadly signal "h-hey.. I can k-kinda do s-statistics... too.?"
- I haven't slept longer than 5 hours in a week and it seems objectively true that sleep deprivation is not a condition that's outright negative, as it's been maligned, but rather a perspective-enhancing altered state of consciousness with health implications, like DRUGS.
- machiavelli said when there's conflict between your subordinates, always pick a side! A. you don't pick a side, the winner hates you and has clout, the loser also hates you, your status erodes B. you pick a side, you tip the scales, winner is now clouted and indebted to you; sounds true and runs somewhat contrary to common wisdom of finding balance and so on
- the American mind is eternally cheerful, the Central European mind is notoriously full of tragedy this contrast manifests in all aspects of behaviour and often leads to a clash -- everyone hated Henry Kissinger until he learned to make self-deprecating jokes.. only then did he catapult to stardom for his acclaimed dry wit America's favorite critique is that one takes oneself too seriously.... if Peter Thiel wants to improve his public image, and if his PR team is worth anything, they will advise him to start jestermaxxing -- this can be done in a variety of ways: a funny outfit, tongue-in-cheek on the Antichrist, fresh online persona run by a zoomer... a single viral wave could turn him into a public sweetheart -- a potentially critical variable in the hyper-populist half-decade
- a kind commenter pointed out that Bryan Johnson executed this playbook perfectly -- a "vampmaxxer" at the brink of persona-death revived by a tasteful dose of "jestermaxxing"
