[AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/)

  - AI 2027 is a detailed, speculative scenario created by a team of researchers and writers—including former OpenAI staff and well-known AI forecasters—to predict how the rise of superhuman artificial intelligence (AI) could transform society, geopolitics, and technology over the next few years. The project aims to be concrete and quantitative, offering a narrative that extrapolates current trends, incorporates expert feedback, and draws on wargames and previous forecasting successes.
