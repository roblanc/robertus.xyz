Recommended resources on successful industrial and applied research labs. I highly recommend these materials. Additional suggestions are greatly appreciated. Also, is the perception that their golden age has passed accurate, or has there been a structural shift in how they operate?

- [Dealers of Lightning](https://www.amazon.com/Dealers-Lightning-Xerox-PARC-Computer/dp/0887309895). The definitive book about PARC.
- [Inside PARC: the 'information' architects](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ns/pdfs/inside-the-parc.pdf) (IEEE Spectrum, Oct 1985). Good article about PARC.
- [Interview with Bob Taylor](http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Taylor_Robert/102702015.05.01.acc.pdf) (and [another](https://patrickcollison.com/static/files/labs/taylor-markoff-interview.pdf)), who ran the PARC CS Lab.
- [The Idea Factory](https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797). The definitive book about Bell Labs. (There should be more...)
- [The Art of Doing Science and Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning/dp/9056995006). Only indirectly about Bell Labs but so good that you should read it anyway.
- [Tuxedo Park](https://www.amazon.com/Tuxedo-Park-Street-Science-Changed/dp/0684872889). Book about the MIT Rad Lab, among other things. (Also worth reading [Endless Frontier](https://www.amazon.com/Endless-Frontier-Vannevar-Engineer-American/dp/0262740222). Broader influence of [NDRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Research_Committee) is underestimated, as far as I can tell.)
- [MIT's Building 20: "The Magical Incubator"](https://infinitehistory.mit.edu/video/mits-building-20-magical-incubator). Transcript of a talk about [Building 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_20).
- [Funding Breakthrough Research: Promises and Challenges of the “ARPA Model”](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents/?DocumentID=4615). An analysis of what the ARPA model is and why it might work.
- [The Dream Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-Licklider-Revolution-Computing/dp/014200135X). Book about ARPA, Licklider, and the creation of the internet.
- [The Power of the Context](https://patrickcollison.com/static/files/labs/context.pdf). Alan Kay's reflections on ARPA and PARC.
- [The Making of the Atomic Bomb](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Atomic-Bomb-25th-Anniversary/dp/1451677618/). Book about the Manhattan Project.
- [Skunk Works](https://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed-ebook/dp/B00A2DIW3C). The Lockheed Martin [facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works) behind the U-2, SR-71, etc. (See also: [Kelly Johnson's 14 Rules](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/aeronautics/skunkworks/kelly-14-rules.html), [Kelly Johnson's own memoir](https://www.amazon.com/Kelly-More-Than-Share-All/dp/0874745640/), [Augustine's Laws](https://www.amazon.com/Augustines-Chairman-Lockheed-Corporation-Augustine/dp/1563472406), [Boyd](https://www.amazon.com/Boyd-Fighter-Pilot-Who-Changed/dp/0316796883), and [National Defense](https://www.amazon.com/National-Defense-James-Fallows/dp/0394518241).)
- [Organizing Genius](https://www.amazon.com/Organizing-Genius-Secrets-Creative-Collaboration/dp/0201339897): an exploration of commonalities across the Manhattan Project, Black Mountain College, Skunk Works, etc. [Demis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis) from DeepMind commented that it accords with how he manages the company.
- [Sidewinder](https://www.amazon.com/Sidewinder-Creative-Missile-Development-China/dp/1591149819). A history of the development of the Sidewinder missile and of the [China Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Air_Weapons_Station_China_Lake) Navy research lab.

(Worked with Bush at NDRC during WWII; helped fund Green Revolution; funded most of the Nobel-winning molecular biologists.) Worth a quick skim—some good passages.
- [Alvarez: Adventures Of A Physicist](https://www.amazon.com/Alvarez-Adventures-Physicist-Alfred-Foundation/dp/0465001165). Luis Alvarez's first-hand account of participating in the development of [GCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-controlled_approach), radar, and the Manhattan Project.
- [Doing the Impossible](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Impossible-Management-Spaceflight-Exploration/dp/1461437008). How George Mueller managed the Apollo Program.
