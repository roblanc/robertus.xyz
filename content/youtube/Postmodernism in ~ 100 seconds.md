A group of blind men encounter an elephant for the first time and they touche a different part of the elephant—the trunk, the leg and the tail. Based on their limited experience each man forms a different and incomplete understanding of what the elephant is. One might describe it as a snake, another as a tree trunk and another as a rope. They argue vehemently about what the elephant really is, each convinced they are right unaware of the larger picture. Postmodern philosophers have been trying to integrate that idea into philosophy.

Some argue that postmodern philosophy is an attempt to grapple with the Uncertainty Principle derived from the research into sub-atomic particles which limits the precision of measuring properties like position and momentum. Schrödinger showed that in complex quantum systems multiple states can exist concurrently not just as interpretations, but as actual physical possibilities though measurement forces the system into a single definite state.

Emerging in the mid-20th century as a reaction to modernism, postmodernism critiques the notions of objectivity and rationality that dominated the Enlightenment and modernist periods. Thinkers like Jean-François Lyotard declared the "incredulity toward metanarratives" and argues that these grand narratives are used to legitimize power structures, and should instead be deconstructed to reveal the diversity of human experience. Although definitions of postmodernism vary, at its core it rejects all-encompassing theories and grand narratives, insisting that society is too complex to be captured by simple models.

Some important figures in postmodernism include Baudrillard, Derrida, Foucault and Lacan, each contributing significantly to the discourse surrounding this complex and multifaceted intellectual movement.

Canadian theorist Linda Hutcheon says that It is rather like saying something while at the same time putting inverted commas around what is being said. The effect is to highlight or 'highlight' and to subvert or 'subvert' and the mode is therefore a 'knowing' and an ironic or even 'ironic' one."

One can say that postmodernism emerged as a cultural reaction to the existential threat of nuclear weapons, the pervasive influence of state-controlled mass media and public relations in both capitalist and communist societies, and a radical push for artistic freedom, as vividly captured in works like Gravity’s Rainbow.

Postmodern art and culture fuse diverse styles, irony, and self-reference to blur the lines between high and low culture, challenging traditional boundaries as seen in the works of architects like Robert Venturi and filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino. It relies heavily on referencing existing works and styles and establishes a particular structure genre or approach only to then immediately distance itself from it often through ironic self-awareness. Essentially it's always pointing to something else while simultaneously winking at the audience about its own construction.

If modernism is about questioning, challenging, and subverting rules and conventions, then post-modernism is about breaking and reinventing rules and conventions. That’s Postmodernism in a nutshell. If you enjoyed the video don’t forget to like share or subscribe and I will see you in the next one.
