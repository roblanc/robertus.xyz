- Took my grandfather to the train station for his daily beverage with friends and picked him up an hour later. It's a poignant reminder of the cycle of life, seeing him use a cane now, and it brings back memories of him picking me up from kindergarten. It's a bit unsettling to witness life's progression through these moments, but I need to embrace it.

- follow levels io tweet about Tweeting and create some sort of program that suggests tweets based on your jurnal entries and blog, tweet like him

## 2025-08-05 - Tuesday, August 05, 2025

-   Started the process of resurrecting my Substack newsletter, "Link Incubator" https://linkincubator.substack.com/archive
-   Apply for the Daily Newsletter Writer position at Works in Progress: https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/were-hiring-daily-newsletter-writer
-   Continued building out the `rtheory` project by updating the "Tools" and "Projects" pages. This is a concrete step towards creating the public portfolio I planned.
-   Reflecting on the past few days, it's clear that documenting my journey and projects is becoming a key part of my strategy. Each update to the site makes my skills more tangible and visible.
-   The process of tracking my own progress reinforces the value of the 'Journalist Agent' idea. Every entry I write is essentially data for a future version of that project.
-   Transcribed several YouTube videos from my channel. The last video transcribed was: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NPq9bMSYJI`.
-   Received a rejection from Ruby Labs for a Junior QA job based solely on my resume. This highlights the need to improve my QA resume in the future.
-   **Personality Reflection (as of 2025-08-04):**
    -   My consistent MBTI results as an **INTJ-A (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging - Assertive)** since 2019 confirm a stable core personality. This is characterized by a strong preference for internal processing, abstract and future-oriented thinking, logical analysis, and a structured, decisive approach to life.
    -   The evolution of my scores, particularly the increasing percentages in Judging, indicates a growing emphasis on planning, organization, and execution over time. My high Intuition remains a constant, driving my interest in complex ideas and long-term vision.
    -   My Assertive trait consistently highlights self-assurance and confidence in my abilities, which is a key component in pursuing ambitious projects and navigating challenges.
    -   This personality type strongly aligns with my journal entries, which showcase a highly analytical, strategic, and self-driven individual dedicated to continuous learning, skill mastery, and the systematic implementation of goals across various domains, from content creation to software quality assurance.
    -   **Areas for Growth:** While your INTJ traits drive significant accomplishment, potential areas for continued development could include refining interpersonal communication to foster stronger collaboration, cultivating greater flexibility when faced with unexpected changes, and further exploring emotional intelligence to enhance both self-awareness and relationships. Your reflections on others' perceived lack of patience or depth might indicate opportunities to practice empathy and adapt communication styles.
-   Completed a significant QA-related task by automating YouTube video transcription for analysis. This involved:
    -   **Skills Developed:** Scripting, automation, data processing, troubleshooting (virtual environment environment setup), file management, and content preparation.
    -   **Technologies Used:** Python, Bash scripting, yt-dlp, Whisper ASR, Markdown.
    -   This task is a valuable addition to my QA portfolio and will be useful for future resume building.
-   Broke up with deli_tiny two days ago. This might be related to my personality and not seeing or texting her enough. As an INTJ, my strong focus on internal projects and efficiency can sometimes lead to less frequent external communication, which may have impacted the relationship.
-   Working on a "Feminism in 100 seconds" video for the Robertus channel.
-   [DONE] Post a video on Aperitif youtube channel.
-   Gemini is amazing.
-   Applied for 5 QA-related jobs and internships, embracing the opportunity to start from scratch.
-   Brainstorming pathways into software development without a traditional CS background. I'm feeling optimistic that with the rise of AI-powered tools like this CLI, deep programming knowledge might become less of a barrier, as I can find answers and solutions much more efficiently.
-   I found and removed duplicate files from my computer.
-   **TODO:** Project Idea: Create a 'Journalist Agent' AI. It could read my journal entries, identify recurring themes or goals, and proactively suggest new project ideas, learning topics, or people to connect with. This would be a great way to practice building autonomous systems and could provide real value by helping me stay on track with my long-term ambitions.
-   Got some excellent ideas for QA preparation projects. I'll be focusing on three types of projects to build a strong portfolio:
    1.  **Full-Cycle QA on an Existing Application:** Find an open-source project on GitHub, create a test plan, write and execute test cases, and report bugs. This will showcase my understanding of the entire QA process.
    2.  **The API Specialist:** Use a tool like Postman to test a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder). I'll create a collection of tests to validate endpoints, status codes, and responses. This demonstrates my ability to test the backend.
    3.  **The Automation Portfolio:** Build a small automated test suite for a practice website like `saucedemo.com` using a framework like Cypress, Playwright, or Selenium. This will be the most impressive project, showcasing my technical skills.
-   All projects will be documented in a GitHub repository with a clear `README.md` file.
-   **Note to self:** This is a marathon, not a sprint. Keep practicing, keep building, and stay consistent. The hard work now will pay off.
-   Created a script to quickly fetch the transcript from a YouTube video and save it to a folder.
-   Discovered and confirmed that the `youtube-transcriber.sh` script downloads YouTube videos as MP3 files using `yt-dlp`.
-   Created a portfolio for a Content Specialist role at UiPath, including:
    -   **White Paper:** "Prompt Engineering Is the New Business Logic" - An 8-page enterprise white paper connecting UiPath products to strategic outcomes.
    -   **Podcast Concept:** "Converging Agentic AI & RPA – A Strategic Imperative for Financial Services" - A scripted episode concept blending strategy with accessibility.
    -   **Slide Deck:** "Converging Agentic AI & RPA – A Strategic Imperuative for Financial Services" - An executive presentation synthesizing UiPath white paper content into a business case.
-   Refactored the youtube-transcriber script into two separate scripts: `get_audio.sh` for downloading MP3s and `transcribe.sh` for transcription.
-   Published the article "AI Cults Are Coming" on Medium (https://robertus.medium.com/ai-cults-are-coming-a95bc8411047) as part of an effort to resurrect my online presence.
-   Started working on a script titled "why i believe in agi (for now)", with the goal of producing a philosophical YouTube video in the style of Sisyphus55.
-   Noted that as of today, Alexey Guzey believes in AGI.
-   Set up a macOS Folder Action to automatically import the journal into Bear Notes whenever it's updated.
-   Confirmed the Bear Notes automation is working with a final test.
-   Running a second confirmation test for the Bear Notes automation.
-   Testing the rebuilt shortcut with explicit 'Get Name' action.
-   Testing with the Automator logging script to diagnose the issue.
-   Running a test before re-registering the Folder Action.
-   Final test of Bear Notes integration using direct `shortcuts run` command.
-   Testing the new 'Add text to a note' (replace mode) logic in Bear Shortcut.
-   Retrying the Bear Notes integration test after confirming shortcut name and Quick Action setting.
-   Testing the simplified Bear Notes shortcut (always creates a new note).
-   Running test after re-saving the shortcut to refresh its registration.
-   Running another test with the simplified Bear Notes shortcut.
-   Final test with the complete Bear Notes shortcut logic (find and update/create).
-   Adding a new entry to test the Bear Notes update functionality.
-   Applied for a QA job following Headless Headhunter HR tips (who also has a YouTube channel), curious if they work.
-   Consider an R&D engineer project at some point, meaning that I should learn that stuff as well as one guy Andrei Sterea learned programming by himself to have a job and ended up doing stuff like this: - Designed and developed the UI for the U-GARDEN Multi-Criteria Tool, creating an intuitive interface to evaluate urban gardening feasibility and simplify decision-making.
-   Leveraged Material-UI for a cohesive design, customizing interactive components like tables, modals, buttons, and dropdowns for a seamless user experience.
-   Integrated Leaflet for interactive mapping, embedding real-time maps to visualize spatial data and help users identify optimal urban gardening locations.
-   Co-authored the research paper on Urban Garden Management using IoT Monitoring Systems and Multi-Criteria Applications.
-   Authored comprehensive user documentation, creating detailed guides to help users fully utilize the application's features and functionalities.
-   Built the CREATE Tool, a React-based SPA for visualizing urban asset data and enabling predictive modeling of material flows.
-   Integrated geolocation APIs to map urban materials accurately to specific buildings, enhancing spatial data analysis capabilities.
-   Collaborated cross-functionally with backend developers and project managers to align design and functionality with project goals.
    Technologies: JavaScript, React, Redux, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Leaflet.js
    Tools: Webpack, Git, GitHub, Heroku

   Writing is as important as speaking as a medium for communicating thought. For this reason, it is said that writing is a secondary power of speech, and those who cannot read are, in part, mute. Scrolls that cannot be read may be compared to speech that cannot be understood, and writing that is difficult to decipher can be likened to stammering speech. Theory directs, and art performs; therefore, inform the mind and train the hand. If you aim to achieve high excellence in penmanship, you must master the principles and practice them faithfully.

# Reference Article on Understanding

[How To Understand Things](https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/understanding?utm_medium=email&triedRedirect=true)

The smartest person I’ve ever known had a habit that, as a teenager, I found striking. After he’d prove a theorem, or solve a problem, he’d go back and continue thinking about the problem and try to figure out different proofs of the same thing. Sometimes he’d spend hours on a problem *he’d already solved*.

I had the opposite tendency: as soon as I’d reached the end of the proof, I’d stop since I’d “gotten the answer”.

I concluded that **what we call 'intelligence' is as much about virtues such as honesty, integrity, and bravery, as it is about 'raw intellect’.**

Intelligent people *simply aren’t willing to accept answers that they don’t understand* — no matter how many other people try to convince them of it, or how many other people believe it, if they aren’t able to convince them selves of it, they won’t accept it.

---

This quality of “not stopping at an unsatisfactory answer” deserves some examination.

**One component of it is energy: thinking hard takes effort**, and it’s much easier to just stop at an answer that seems to make sense, than to pursue everything that you don’t quite get down an endless, and rapidly proliferating, series of rabbit holes.

It’s also so easy to think that you understand something, when you actually don’t. So even figuring out whether you understand something or not requires you to attack the thing from multiple angles and test your own understanding.

This requires a lot of intrinsic motivation, because it’s so hard; so most people simply don’t do it.

---

But a deep understanding of law really requires understanding so many things, such that I could never reach that point where I could say, "Okay, I've got it, now let's use this groundwork to start thinking about legal doctrine". Examples: What even is law? Legal philosophy. Indeterminacy of language and interpretation? Philosophy of language. Distinguishing right and wrong? Moral philosophy, then moral psychology once it became clear to me that morals have to do with groups and emotions. How about understanding society, the realm of law's application and origin? Sociology/Social theory. Not to mention the huge body of "postmodern" work that has grown up around it which sees everything as a social construct, an effect of discourse/power, humans themselves as lacking the kind of agency assumed in law and liberal political philosophy.

And despite everything I have written, I don't feel like I've gotten a grasp on things. (Social) reality is such a massive, incomprehensible beast where everything is chaotically intertwined, arguably unlike mathematics where you can advance your understanding in little, isolated chunks at a time, with reasonable confidence that you've made sense of it. Some days I feel like I've wasted all my energy trying to analyse all these underlying dynamics of law and society, that I've entered a field where the "will to know" never pays off (you never see the full picture) and simply rips your common sense worldview apart without offering anything in return.

Thanks for the essay, it allowed me to explore my thoughts in the preceding paragraphs :)

      > Some thoughts about how the week went. Currently Saturday. Worked on microlecturi.ro in a 3-day sequance. People have stupid problems. Emotionally. Fried brain. No patiance. Sad. How do you fight it? How do you cure the cancer in people? If you have no patiance to even type properly to find a word, a phrase, a solution to a problem. How can you even think clearly?

   > **Thoughts of the week**  Sunday. Full weekend with friends. I have rewatched my YouTube videos at Virgil Baldovin s house after night of programming and creating a new app. I thought that I look and speak good, and was proud of them after a long time of being afraid to watch due to cringe like potential effects. He thought they were damn good too, paying unusual attention to them and watching quite lots. Another influence might have been transfered on to himself as at this time he is trying to learn English, taking courses and what not. And seeing a friend's videos where the friend talks English might have been a potential trigger that he wanted to instinctively push in order for him to have a comparison and something to strive towards that's part of his immediate reality. But remember, comparison is the death of joy, but who doesn't like a lowkey subtle competition?
